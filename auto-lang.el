;;; Commentary:
;;
;; auto-lang is an Emacs package which tries to find the language of
;; the current buffer and set ispell-dictionary according to that.  It
;; may be useful for writing texts, especially in with conjunction with
;; flyspell mode.  It can also differentiate between different encodings
;; for the same language.

;;; Documentation:
;;
;; In your ~/.emacs, add the lines
;;   (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/path/to/lisp/file/") load-path))
;;   (require 'auto-lang)
;;
;; Then enable whatever you like in the following:
;;
;;; Automatically enable auto-lang for Gnus:
;; (add-hook 'message-setup-hook
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (auto-lang-minor-mode t)))
;;
;;; Automatically enable auto-lang for VM:
;; (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (auto-lang-minor-mode t)))
;;
;;; Automatically enable auto-lang for all text based modes:
;; (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (auto-lang-minor-mode t)))
;;
;; You can also toggle the mode manually with
;;   M-x auto-lang-minor-mode

(provide 'auto-lang)

;; ==============================================================================

; Ideas/TODO:

; ! Have commands "auto-lang-guess-language-buffer" and
;   "auto-lang-guess-language-paragraph" that do what the name says.

; ! Use (executable-find "ispell") to see if ispell (or aspell) are
;   present on the system at all. Ideally, this would be in ispell.el.

; ! Check out the de, en, fr stopword lists at http://www.loria.fr/~bonhomme/sw/.

; ! Do independent statistics, where stopwords would select the
;   language and the number of "a versus ae versus ‰ (versus a",
;   versus \"a, versus...)  would select the encoding, and both
;   together would select the dictionary... (suggestion by Sven Utcke)

; ! auto-lang.el could be used to e.g. insert \selectlanguage commands
;   into LaTeX buffers.

; ! In buffer mode, it makes no sense to switch off flyspell and un-set
;   ispell-dictionary for the far-moving keys like (ctrl home) etc.

; ! In buffer mode in message-mode, skip quoted parts for determining
;   the language (ispell.el has functions for this).
;   (feature request by Sven Utcke)

; ! Make sure read-only buffers are handled gracefully.

; ! Let the user choose which languages she wants to test against. Not
;   everybody writes in all the supported languages... (idea from
;   Benjamin Drieu's guess-lang.el)

; ! If there are a lot of spelling errors, do not declare a winner
;   even though the normal calculation is fine. (Only do this if
;   ispell is available.)

; ! If one produces spaces on a line with no words, auto-lang should
;   pick up the next paragraph for checking.

; ! Thing to customize: sometimes, one word is not enough in a buffer
;   with many words. Have a minimum number of necessary matches, or
;   number of matches against buffer/paragraph word count.

; ! make most functions non-interactive

; ! add more documentation to functions and variables (and general
;   usage)

; ! make many setq's to let's

; * debug aid: temporarily spread an overlay over the paragraph that
;   is checked.

; * If there are two (or maybe three) consecutive SPC keystrokes,
;   switch off the language checking. User probably wants to indent
;   something.

; * Make a script which extracts all words of a language from a text
;   (.po-files would probably be good) and extract the most used
;   words (stopwords). (Check out textstats.el and concordance.el
;   from http://members.a1.net/t.link/filestats.html)

; * have a minimum buffer size before beginning to check language

; * if there are a lot of spelling errors (in German for instance),
;   check if they would not occur if you use another character
;   encoding for that language

; * Offer to set local variables at end of file when buffer is
;   associated to a file.

; * Check out
;   http://www.linuxcare.it/developers/davidw/files/two-mode-mode.el
;   "switches the entire buffer mode based on where your cursor is"

; * (setq ispell-extra-args (list "-w" "‡‚ÁËÈÍÎÔÙ˘˚¸¿¬«» …œ‘Ÿ€‹"))

; * check if flyspell is byte-compiled (with byte-code-function-p or
;   compiled-function-p)

; * catch mouse movements (see GNU Emacs' which-function and
;   semantic-imenu's advice to that)

; * If a buffer/paragraph only contains e.g. "fuer f¸r", then
;   'deutsch8' is selected unanimously. It should be '[deutsch]' however
;   (undecided), or maybe 'deutsch' (thus marking both entries
;   as wrong -- the writer has probably mixed these writings up
;   and wants to decide on only one).

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:

; * make deutsch8 and deutsch7 etc. [DONE]

; * Use regexp-opt to build the regexp from a list of words. [DONE]

; * alist which consists of real language name, ispell dictionary
;   name and name symbol to be shown in the status line [DONE]

; * have everything customizable (via custom) (halfway DONE)

; * check for existance of an available dictionary for the selected
;   language (maybe check even physically with "locate"), offer to
;   customize the language-->dictionary relation if needed [DONE]

; * Have an easy to access function that jumps to a match for a
;   certain language.
;   Maybe this could even highlight matches, ideally in different
;   colors for each language. [DONE]

; ! fix "Arithmetic error!" when there is no empty line after the
;   first line [DONE]

; ! update modeline after customization of al-mode-line-string [DONE]

; ! if al-mode-line-string is "", then make sure that nothing
;   is printed at all [DONE]

; ! make ispell-dictionary buffer-local (is this possible?)
;   [DONE, use ispell-local-dictionary]

; ! make sure it works even without flyspell [DONE, works w/o ispell too]

; * if a variable (e.g. al-trace-buffer) is non-nil, write out
;   debugging information to this buffer [DONE]

; * More debugging functions. Use e.g. trace. [DONE]

; * use flyspell-region to check smaller regions if the buffer is
;   too large (custom variable for max-buffer-size)        [DONE]

; * have a variable al-version [DONE (auto-lang-version)]

; * <Cursor-up> etc. should switch off flyspell in a sensible way. [DONE]

; * make use of ispell and flyspell completely optional, even if
;   they are installed [DONE]

; * check if maybe regexp-opt-charset is important for regexp-opt
;   here [DONE, but different fix]

; When checking for confidence differences between the base
; languages, I probably should check the *best* confidence for a
; certain base language against the next base language (which is the
; best of *this* base language if sorted). Right now, just the two
; base languages adjacent to each other are compared.
;
; Example:
;
; (("german" "deutsch8" 0.3015113445777636)
; ("german" "deutsch" 0.2713602101199872)
; ("english" "english" 0.1206045378311054)
; ("english" "american" 0.1206045378311054)
; ("english" "british" 0.1206045378311054)
; ("portugese" "portugese8" 0.0)
; ("portugese" "portugese7" 0.0)
; ("spanish" "spanish" 0.0)
; ("french" "francais" 0.0))
;
; Here we should check the confidence of deutsch8 against english
; and not deutsch since the extra words of deutsch8 make it even
; more clear what the right language is. OTOH, deutsch will never
; have a higher confidence value than deutsch8, it will at most be
; the same and be selected because of the order of definitions
; in al-guess-buffer-language.
; In the current implementation, I would check deutsch and english
; since these two are neigbours.
; [IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.]

; ! do not switch on flyspell if a language dictionary is not available [DONE]

; > BTW, how do I read in a file with a word on each line and convert it
; > to a list? (Reason: I want to export my word lists for auto-lang.el
; > to external files.)
;
; How about that:
;
; (set-buffer (find-file-noselect file-name nil t))
; (while (looking-at "\\(\\w+\\)[ \n]*")
;   (setq word-list (cons (match-string 1) word-list))
;   (goto-char (match-end 1)))
; (kill-buffer (current-buffer))

; Suggestions by Jorge Godoy <godoy(at)conectiva.com>:
;
; 1. Ignore quoted text while checking for the idiom (we work in a
;    multinational company and it's common to forward text mixed in
;    English, Spanish and Portuguese)
; 2. Ignore attachments (other than the first one)
; 3. Make it easily adaptable, I mean, easy to change words, remove
;    some, add others, etc. If they are out of the Lisp code it would be
;    much better. You might even create a directory with these word
;    definitions and to add a new language it would be as simple as
;    adding a new file to it.
; 4. Document it all. If you can use SGML (preferably DocBook) I can
;    help you. DocBook can create texinfo files, so you would be loved
;    by us, and by everybody who wants a PostScript, a PDF, a HTML, a
;    plain ASCII, etc. version of your document.
; 5. Make a script which reads some files and count the occorence of
;    each word and write it and the number of times it occurs on a
;    separate file. It would help people to send some words to you (they
;    won't have to worry with how many times they happen and how common
;    they are since the program count these words to them). You could
;    ask the full file or just the first 50 lines (from where you'd
;    choose the desired 10-20 words).
